# Exploring Design Patterns with Kotlin

Project just to show some Design Patterns usage. 

This project was made in response to the DIO Lab _"Explorando Padrões de Projetos na Prática com Java"_, which shows the following patterns:
- Singleton
- Strategy/Repository
- Facade

## Considerations 
- The Kotlin and Gradle was used instead Java and Maven.
- The structure of this project follow (or try to) the structure proposed by _[Tom Hombergs](https://github.com/thombergs)_ in your book _["Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture"](https://leanpub.com/get-your-hands-dirty-on-clean-architecture)_.
- This project also use some principles of [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134494164), both proposed by from _[Robert C. Martin](http://cleancoder.com/products)_.
- This project doesn't use [OpenFeign](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-openfeign), as instructed in the class, but use [HTTP interfaces](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.0.0/reference/html/integration.html#rest-http-interface) instead.
